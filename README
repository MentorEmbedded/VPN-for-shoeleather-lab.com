The shoeleather.ovpn config file references shoeleather.creds for your
username and password.  It also calls the scripts shoeleather.up and
shoeleather.down, which modify your /etc/resolv.conf to add the proper
DNS information for shoeleather.  shoeleather.up and shoeleather.down
are fairly brute-force right now, but they will probably work.  You
may need to suit them to your needs.

0) Ensure the openvpn package is installed

1) Edit shoeleather.creds so that the first line is your username
and the second line is your password

2) Start up the vpn with:
   sudo openvpn shoeleather.ovpn
